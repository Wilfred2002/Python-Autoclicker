# Autoclicker

An autoclicker that will click wherever your mouse is automatically at a set custom interval for the user. Coded in python.


## How to Run

Make sure to install pynput. Download autoclicker.py, navigate to your terminal and type the commands below
```bash
pip install pynput
```
```bash
python autoclicker.py
```
## Customization
Navigate to your local autoclicker.py file and check the variable TOGGLE_KEY and TimeBetweenClicks. You can change these to any variable as needed.
```python
TOGGLE_KEY = KeyCode(char="-")
TimeBetweeenClicks = 70
```
